The USAID STRIDE capacity in science, technology, and program's goal is to strengthen the science, technology, research, and innovation capacity in Philippine higher education with a focus on disciplines that contribute to high-growth economic sectors. Two essential objectives that must be met to successfully achieve the goal are improving research innovation fields and strengthening partnerships between industry and academy for applied research.</p><br>
